When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Sharing your work with the wider community for them to use, extend and improve.
    Also with it remotely you don't necessarily need your local store - you could still work on the repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Depending on how you have the remote repo set up you could be drawing other changes down locally
    that have been provided by others that you don't want to absorb. Keeping it manual gives you the choice
    about what stays in your master repo.
